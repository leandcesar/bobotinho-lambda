DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASS=your-database-password
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=your-database-port

Execute the following commands in your `/bobotinho-lambdas` directory:

```bash
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ chalice local
```

### üß™ Test

Execute the following commands in your `/bobotinho-lambdas` directory:

```bash
$ pytest tests/ --cov
```

### üöÄ Deploy

Execute the following commands in your `/bobotinho-lambdas` directory:

```bash
$ chalice deploy --stage prod
```
